It allows to build long-lived dynamic application, supporting hot-plugs and updates.\r\n* [jsonrpclib-pelix](http://github.com/tcalmant/jsonrpclib): A fork of [jsonrpclib by Josh Marshall](https://github.com/joshmarshall/jsonrpclib). It provides supports for JSON-RPC 2.0 (client and server side) for Python 2.7+ and 3.3+.\r\n* [javaobj-py3](https://github.com/tcalmant/python-javaobj): A fork of [javaobj](https://github.com/vbuell/python-javaobj) by Volodymyr Buell. This library allows to read the content of a Java serialized file in pure Python. This version also allows to serialize some basic types in Java format.\r\n\r\nI also worked on those project, left aside for the moment:\r\n* [JPype-Py3](https://github.com/tcalmant/jpype-py3): this library allows to start a Java Virtual Machine inside the Python interpreter process using JNI. This is a fork of [JPype](http://jpype.sourceforge.net/index.html) by Steve Menard. This version only supports Python 3. This project is now dormant as [Luis Nell's fork](https://github.com/originell/jpype) is more active and supports both Python 2 and 3.\r\n* [iPOJO Nature for Eclipse](http://gitorious.ow2.org/ow2-chameleon/eclipse-ipojo-builder): a plugin for Eclipse which eases the development of [iPOJO](http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-ipojo.html) \r\ncomponents in Eclipse.\r\n* [ReST Editor](https://sourceforge.net/projects/resteditor/): an Eclipse plugin to edit reStructuredText files, with minimal support for [Sphinx](www.sphinx-doc.org/) projects.",
